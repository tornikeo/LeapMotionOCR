This repository contains files for 2023 PRML final project. 


## Description

Matlab uses a `digit_classify.m` file to invoke the file called `main.py`. We also built a `Runner.m` to test that `digit_classify.m` indeed works well.

We also have `train.py` and `test.py` these files are used for creating the pickled models that are used by `main.py`

`utils.py` contains most of the hand-made ML and support code that we use to replace Scikit's functions.
